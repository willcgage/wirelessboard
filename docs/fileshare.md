Wirelessboard's configuration directory can be shared via [Samba](https://www.samba.org). This makes it easy to remotely add backgrounds, edit Wirelessboard configurations, and view logs. Legacy Micboard installs can use the same approachâ€”simply substitute the older directory names shown in parentheses below.

Slots now render their artwork with dedicated HTML5 `<img>` and `<video>` elements, so any JPEG background or muted, looping MP4 that modern browsers can decode will play automatically once it lands in the shared `backgrounds/` folder. See the [configuration guide](configuration.md#background-images) for details on how filenames are matched to channel names and the recommended codecs.

### MacOS
![mac fileshare](img/smb_server_mac.png)
On MacOS, open up the Sharing pane within System Preferences

Enable File Sharing

Add the Wirelessboard config folder (`~/Library/Application Support/wirelessboard/`; legacy: `.../micboard/`).

### Debian Servers (Ubuntu & Raspberian)
Install Samba

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install samba
```

Add a share for Wirelessboard in /etc/samba/smb.conf (rename to `micboard` if you are still running the legacy service).

```
[wirelessboard]
    comment = Wirelessboard
    path = /home/wirelessboard/.local/share/wirelessboard
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
```

Add a user for the share
```
$ sudo smbpasswd -a wirelessboard
```

restart samba and enable it at startup

```
$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
$ sudo systemctl enable smbd
```
